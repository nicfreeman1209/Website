			<p><b> Topics	</b></p>

			I am interested in taking PhD students to work on my own research areas,
			as well as those with industry focused projects.<br>
			<br>
			A description of my research interests within probability theory can be found 
			<a href="research.html"> on this page</a>.
			Students interested in doing a PhD with me on these topics will need
			a good grasp of real analysis as well as an interest in probability.<br>
			<br>
			My background, from both academic and consultancy work, 
			enables me to also become involved in many areas within statistics and machine learning.
			I am also interested to (co-)supervise PhD projects based on particular applications of probability.
			In this case less mathematical background is required
			but competency coding (in Python or C++, preferably) and a good intuition for probability
			is nearly always essential.<br>
			<br>
			Potential applicants should contact me directly.<br>
			<br>
			You might also be interested in 
			other members of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/probabilitygroup/group-members">probability group in Sheffield</a>.
