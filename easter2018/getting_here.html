	To get to the Hicks building from the train station, the quickest way is to take the tram. From inside the train station, go up onto the concourse, exit from the opposite side to the main station building, and the tram stop is right there. You're already on the correct side of the tracks and you'll need to take the blue line to the stop called "University", shown on the map above. The stops are announced. Tickets are bought on the tram, costing Â£1.70.
