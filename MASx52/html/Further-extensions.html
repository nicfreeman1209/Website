// Equation numbering: https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2427
// Starred and ifnextchar macros: https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2428
//
// Modified by Brian Dunn to adjust equation numbering and add subequations.
//
// LaTeX can use \seteqnumber{subequations?}{section}{number} before each equation.
// subequations? is 0 usually, 1 if inside subequations.
// section is a string printed as-is, or empty.
// number is auto-incremented by MathJax between equations.

<a id="notes_2-autopage-172"></a>
<a id="notes_2-autofile-29"></a> <a id="sec:further_extensions"></a>

<p>
In this section we briefly survey a number of further ways in which the standard Black-Scholes model is often extended. Again, we follow our strategy of keeping things simple by studying each extension in isolation.
</p>

<p>
Note that the whole section of Section <a href="Further-extensions.html#sec:further_extensions">15.5</a> is off-syllabus, and marked with \((\star )\)s.
</p>
<h5 id="autosec-173">Time inhomogeneity \((\star )\)</h5>
<a id="notes_2-autopage-173"></a>



<p>
Weâ€™ve kept the model parameters \(r,\mu \) and \(\sigma \) as fixed, deterministic constants throughout our analysis of the Black-Scholes model. In fact, there is no need to do so. It is common to allow \(\mu \)
and \(\sigma \) to depend on both \(t\) and \(S_t\), written \(\mu (t,S_t)\) and \(\sigma (t,S_t)\).
</p>

<p>
The situation for \(r\) is similar. It is common to allow \(r\) to depend on \(t\), but not on \(S_t\), written simply \(r(t)\). The for this choice is simply that reason interest rates are generally not thought to
be dependent on stock prices. Moreover, interest rates tend to vary much more slowly than stock prices, and it is not unusual to assume that \(r\) is constant.
</p>

<p>
Allowing \(r\), \(\mu \) and \(\sigma \) to vary makes the problem of parameter inference much more difficult, but it is easily absorbed (without major changes) into the pricing theory that weâ€™ve studied in this
course. Essentially, the reason that no major changes occur is that our use of Itoâ€™s formula did not ever require us to differentiate \(r\), \(\mu \) or \(\sigma \).
</p>

<p>
In the situation where \(r=r(t)\), \(\mu =\mu (t,S_t)\) and \(\sigma =\sigma (t,S_t)\), it turns out that the risk neutral valuation formula for the contingent claim \(\Phi (S_T)\) turns into
</p>

<p>
\[\Pi _t=e^{-\int _t^T r(u)\,du}\,\E _{t,S_t}^\Q \l [\Phi (S_T)\r ],\]
</p>

<p>
where the risk neutral world \(\Q \) has the dynamics of \(S\) as
</p>

<p>
\[dS_t=r(t)S_t\,dt+\sigma (t,S_t)S_t\,dB_t.\]
</p>

<p>
It is easily seen that this generalizes the version of risk-neutral valuation that we proved in Theorem <a href="The-Black-Scholes-equation.html#thm:bs_repl">14.3.1</a>: when \(r\) is constant we have
\(\int _t^Tr\,du=r(T-t)\). Note, though, that in this case we donâ€™t have the explicit formula <span class="textup" >(<a href="The-Black-Scholes-formula.html#eq:gbm_tT">14.20</a>)</span> for
\(S_T\) in terms of \(S_t\).

<h5 id="autosec-174">American and Exotic options \((\star )\)</h5>
<a id="notes_2-autopage-174"></a>



<a id="sec:exotics"></a>

<p>
We have generally used European call (and sometimes put) options as our canonical examples of financial derivatives. Whilst European call and put options are traded on many stocks, the most common type of
financial derivative is actually the <i>American</i> call/put option.
</p>

<p>
In all our previous work, we assumed that the exercise time \(T\) of an option was agreed in advance, and was deterministic. <b>American options</b> are options in which the holder can choose when to exercise
the option. For example, an American call option with strike \(K\) and â€˜finalâ€™ exercise date \(T\), gives the holder the right to buy one unit of stock \(S_t\) for a (pre-agreed, deterministic) strike price \(K\) <i>at
a time of their own choosing</i> during \([0,T]\).
</p>

<p>
The time \(\tau \) at which the holder chooses to exercise their right to buy may depend on the current value of the stock price. As a result, the argument that we used to derive the prices (in Section <a
href="The-Black-Scholes-equation.html#sec:bs_eq">14.3</a>) breaks down. The underlying cause is that they relate to a family of PDEs that are much more difficult to handle than the standard
Black-Scholes PDEs â€“ and for which Feynman-Kac formulas are not known to exist. In some special cases (including the case of American call options) explicit hedging strategies that are known, which allow explicit
formulas for prices to be found, but in general numerical techniques are the only option.

Another interesting class of financial derivatives are <b>exotic options</b>. This is a general term used for options in which the contingent claim is either complicated to write down, or simply of an unusual form.
They include
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">


<li>
<p>
1. <b>digital options</b>, which give a fixed payoff if (and only if) the stock price is above a particular threshold;
</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>
2. <b>barrier options</b>, in which the exercise rights of the holder vary according to whether the stock price has crossed particular thresholds;
</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>
3. <b>Asian options</b>, whose payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset during a particular time period;
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and many other variants (such as cliquet, rainbow, lookback, chooser, Bermudean, \(\ldots \)). Often such options are not traded on stock exchanges because there is insufficient demand for their individual
characteristics. As a result, their prices are agreed through direct discussions between the two (or more) parties involved in the contract. We donâ€™t attempt to make a catalogue of the theory of pricing such options.
If you want to see some examples, there are plenty in Chapters 11-14 of the book â€˜The Mathematics of Financial Derivativesâ€™ by Wilmott, Howison and Dewynne.

was complete, relied only on the fact that \(X\in m\mc {F}_T\) (and not on having the form \(X=\Phi (S_T)\)).
</p>

<p>
As a consequence, we do know that most types of exotic option can be hedged in the Black-Scholes model â€“ but, in general, we donâ€™t know how to find the replicating portfolios.

We now begin to move further afield, towards some serious extensions of the standard Black-Scholes model.
</p>

<p>
The following graph shows the Standard &amp; Poorâ€™s 500 index, usually known in short as the S&amp;P 500, during 1987. It is essentially an averaged value of the stock prices of the top 500 companies within the
American stock market<sup>1</sup>. The S&amp;P 500 is widely regarded as one of the best ways of representing, in a single number, the value of stocks within the U.S.&nbsp;stock markets. We wonâ€™t go into
exactly how the â€˜averageâ€™ is taken.

<p>
The feature of the graph that grabs our immediate attention is the huge fall, which occurs on Monday 19<sup>th</sup> October 1987. This date has become known as <i>Black Monday</i>. We see an
instantaneous drop, with apparently no warning, in which the S&amp;P 500 loses nearly 30% of its value. This is its largest fall ever, over twice the magnitude of the second largest fall (which you may remember: it
occurred on 15<sup>th</sup> October 2008).

<span class="theoremheaderplain" >Remark 15.5.3</span> <a id="autoid-146" ></a >Something which may strike you as very strange: <i>no</i> single explanation for the Black Monday crash has ever
been found. There are various theories as to what triggered the crash, ranging from a sudden lack liquidity to sudden implementations of new pricing methodology. It is often claimed that some <i>high-frequency
trading algorithms</i> (which were relatively new, at the time) were programmed to automatically sell stocks when they saw them drop; meaning that once a small crash occurred there was suddenly a huge number
of investors wanting to sell, exacerbating the drop in prices. However, in this case the largest drops occurred when trading volumes were low, meaning that high frequency trading is unlikely to be the full explanation.
</p>


</li>

</ul>

</div>

<p>
Of the many stock market crashes that have occurred in history, one other deserves special mention: the financial crisis of 2007-8. We will discuss it (briefly) in Chapter <a
href="The-financial-crisis-2007-08.html#chap:2008">16</a>. For now, let us focus on how we might incorporate rare, but sudden, downward drops in prices into the Black-Scholes model.
</p>

<p>
A rapid downward drop in prices is best represented by a discontinuity (downwards) in the stock price. However, the theory of Ito integration that we developed only worked for continuous stochastic process. In
fact, a theory of Ito integration that can handle discontinuities does exist, but it requires much heavier use of analysis than the version we developed. The complication is that, in continuous time, we need to be clear
about what information is known <i>instantaneously before</i> a jump takes place â€“ we cannot allow ourselves to foresee the jump, since this would be unrealistic. Doing so necessitates much more careful use of
\(\sigma \)-fields, filtrations and left/right-continuity than we saw in Chapter <a href="Stochastic-integration.html#chap:ito">11</a>.
</p>

<p>
Happily, there is a generalization of Brownian motion, known as a <i>Le&#x0301;vy process</i>, which naturally incorporates unpredictable jumps, both upwards and/or downwards. It turns out that
Le&#x0301;vy processes are intimately connected to heavy tailed random variables (that is, where \(\E [X]\) or \(\E [X^2]\) is not defined). This, in turn, means we need a further extension of Ito calculus, to
remove our reliance on \(\mc {H}^2\) and allow for infinite means and variances. After all this theoretical work, we can then build versions of the Black-Scholes model that incorporate the possibility of rare, but
unpredictable, jumps in stock prices.
</p>

<p>
To summarize: such extensions are possible (and exist, and are used), but they are much harder to work with.

<h5 id="autosec-181">Volatility \((\star )\)</h5>
<a id="notes_2-autopage-181"></a>



<p>
Let us begin to think a little about what we would need to do to make use of the model, within a real market.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that we would need estimates of the parameters \(r\) and \(\sigma \) (we donâ€™t need to know \(\mu \), because it has no effect on arbitrage free prices). Estimating the interest rate \(r\) is often rather
easy, because interests rates donâ€™t change quickly and they are <i>chosen</i> by banks, who generally also make them public information; so we wonâ€™t worry about \(r\).
</p>

<p>
It is much harder to estimate the volatility \(\sigma \). We focus on this issue for the remainder of this section.
</p>
<h6 id="autosec-182">Historical volatility \((\star )\)</h6>
<a id="notes_2-autopage-182"></a>



<p>
One obvious idea is to estimate the future volatility based on the stock prices that we have observed in the recent past. Let us discuss one method for doing so.
</p>

<p>
Recall that our stock price process follows
</p>

<p>
\[dS_t=\mu S_t\,dt+\sigma S_t\,dB_t\]
</p>

<p>
which, as we saw in Section <a href="Geometric-Brownian-motion.html#sec:gbm">12.2</a>, has solution
</p>

<p>
\[S_t=S_0\exp \l ((\mu -\tfrac 12\sigma ^2)t+\sigma B_t\r ).\]
</p>

<p>
We fix \(\epsilon &gt;0\) and set \(t_i=i\epsilon \). We look at our historical data and find the values of \(S_t\) at times \(t=t_i\), which we assume to all be in the past. Fix some \(n\in \N \) and for
\(i=1,\ldots ,n\) define
</p>

<p>
\[\xi _i=\log \l (\frac {S_{t_i}}{S_{t_{i-1}}}\r ).\]
</p>

<p>
This gives us that
</p>

<p>
\[\xi _i=\l (\mu -\frac {\sigma ^2}{2}\r )\epsilon + \sigma \l (B_{t_i}-B_{t_{i-1}}\r ).\]
</p>

<p>
Using the independence properties of Brownian motion, we have that the \((\xi _i)_{i=1}^n\) are i.i.d.&nbsp;random variables with common distribution
</p>

<p>
\[N\l [(\mu -\tfrac {\sigma ^2}{2})\epsilon ,\;\sigma ^2\epsilon \r ].\]
</p>

<p>
We can estimate their (common) variance \(\epsilon \sigma ^2\) by the sample variance:
</p>

<p>
\[\epsilon \sigma ^2 \approx \frac {1}{n-1}\sum \limits _{i=1}^n\l (\xi _i-\bar \xi \r )^2\]
</p>

<p>
where \(\bar \xi =\frac {1}{n}\sum _{i=1}^n \xi _i\).
</p>
<div class="theorembodyremark" >

<ul style="list-style-type:none">

<li>

<p>
<span class="theoremheaderplain" >Remark 15.5.4</span> <a id="autoid-148" ></a >If you are familiar with statistical inference, you should recognize the maximum likelihood estimator for the variance of
the normal distribution.
</p>


</li>

</ul>

</div>

<p>
We thus obtain the estimator
</p>

<p>
\[\hat \sigma =\frac {1}{\sqrt {\epsilon }}\l (\frac {1}{n-1}\sum \limits _{i=1}^n (\xi _i-\bar \xi )^2\r )^{1/2}\]
</p>

<p>
for \(\sigma \). What we have obtained here is a estimate of what the volatility was during the time period containing \(t_1,\ldots ,t_n\), which is in the past. When we are pricing options, what we would like
to is an estimator of the volatility for future. We might be prepared to assume that the future will be similar to the past, and if we are then we can use \(\hat \sigma \). Unfortunately, in most cases historical
volatilities turn out to be a poor method of predicting future volatilities. With this in mind, we move on and examine an alternative idea.
</p>
<h6 id="autosec-184">Implied volatility and the volatility smile \((\star )\)</h6>
<a id="notes_2-autopage-184"></a>



<p>
Suppose that we wish to gauge what the (rest of the) market thinks is a reasonable estimate for volatility over the next, say, six months. Hereâ€™s one way we could do it.
</p>

<p>
Take our Black-Scholes model. Find the pricing formula for a European call option that has a date of exercise six months into the future. Let us write this price as \(c(K,t,T,r,\sigma )\). We know the value
today of the stock \(S_t\), we have argued that estimating \(r\) is not difficult, we know \(K\), and we know that \(T=\text {six months}\). We can also <i>look at the market</i> and see the price at which
this call option is being sold for â€“ call this price \(p\). We can then solve the equation

<p>
for \(\sigma \), and obtain what is known as the <b>implied volatility</b>, often abbreviated simply to <b>vol</b>. Essentially, this is the volatility that â€˜the marketâ€™ currently believes in.
</p>

<p>
This may seem like a circular procedure; if we were to then use the implied volatility as an estimator for \(\sigma \) and price accordingly, we would discover (at least, in theory) that we might as well have just
charged whatever prices we could already see in the market. However, there is more to this situation that meets the eye.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that we are wanting to price an exotic derivative that is <i>not</i> commonly traded. This means that we cannot see current market prices for it â€“ so we could not use our exotic derivative to find the
implied volatility in the style of <span class="textup" >(<a href="Further-extensions.html#eq:implied_vol">15.6</a>)</span>. But what we can do is:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">


<li>
<p>
1. Look at prices of call options (or some other options, based on the same underlying stock, which are commonly traded) based on this derivative with the same exercise date. Use these to work out the implied
volatility.
</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>
2. Use the resulting implied volatility, in the Black-Scholes model, to compute the price that we should charge for our exotic derivative.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In fact, <i>this</i> is currently the way in which the Black-Scholes model is most commonly used.
</p>

<p>
In another vein, we can use the idea of implied volatility to test the accuracy of the Black-Scholes model. Suppose that we observe the market prices of a number of call options, on the same stock, with the same
exercise date, but with different strike prices. We can use each of these observations to calculate a value for the implied volatility. In theory, each of these calculations should give us the same \(\sigma \).
</p>

<p>
They donâ€™t. In practice, it is often the case that options for which \(S_t\gg K\) or \(S_t\ll K\) (at the current time \(t\)) tend to suggest higher implied volatilities that those for which \(S_t\approx K\). We
thus obtain a graph of implied volatility as a function \(K\), which typically looks like

This picture is known as the <b>volatility smile</b>. The exact shape of the smile varies from market to market, and can also vary substantially over time. Sometimes the smile becomes inverted, and is known as
a â€˜volatility frownâ€™.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the volatility smile reflects deficiencies in the standard version of the Black-Scholes model. It is generally believed that the appearance of the volatility smile is closely connected to the standard
Black-Scholes model not accounting for the possibility of jumps in the stock price; investigating this issue in detail is currently an active area of mathematical finance.
</p>

<p>
Despite the existence of the volatility smile, the Black-Scholes model is used extensively, in practice. The volatility smile provides an indicator of how well/badly the Black-Scholes model is capturing reality. Itâ€™s
consequences, including what can be learned from the precise shape of the smile, are well understood by traders.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that, in practice, decisions taken on trading stocks and shares are based both on information obtained using modelling techniques (such as Black-Scholes) as well as qualitative information (such as
reading the annual general reports of companies, being aware of the political environment, etc). Combining all this information together is a difficult task, which requires understanding the modelling theory well
enough to judge, in detail, which aspects of reality are modelled well and which are not. There is nothing special to the world of finance here â€“ all sophisticated stochastic modelling requires this the same level of
care.

In some markets, the number of (independent) sources of random information is much greater than then number of (independent) commodities that are traded. They are known as <b>incomplete markets</b>. In
practice, it is not particularly easy to judge if a given market fits into this class, but very many do.
</p>

<p>
In an incomplete market we canâ€™t hedge every contingent claim. Consequently, we also canâ€™t deduce arbitrage free prices for every contingent claim. Instead, it is possible to construct arbitrage based arguments to
say that particular relationships exist <i>between</i> contingent claims must exist; statements of the form â€˜if the price of \(X\) is this then the price of \(Y\) must be thatâ€™. Then, by observing some carefully chosen
prices from the market, we have enough information (when combined with the usual arbitrage free pricing methods) to uniquely determine the price of any contingent claim. The â€˜extraâ€™ information, that is observed
via prices, essentially involves quantifying how risk averse the market is towards particular asset classes.

We wonâ€™t go into any details on this procedure in these notes. A good source of further information is Chapter 15 of the book â€˜Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Timeâ€™ by Bjork.
