		Sec 1.7 - fixed some dy that should be d\theta <br>
		Q1.1b - fixed pdf, also in solution<br>
		Q1.7 - fixed calculation in solution <br>
		Q3.2 - swapped parts (a) and (b) around slightly (not a typo - I wanted to make the question better linked to the lectures) <br>
		Q3.4 - added this question, which changes the numbering of later 3.x questions <br>
