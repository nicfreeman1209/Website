		<b>Noteworthy typos that have been found and fixed:</b>
	</p>
		Sec 1.2.1 - fixed R and R^2 being the wrong way around in the bullet points <br>
		Sec 1.7 - fixed some dy that should be d\theta <br>
		Q1.1b - fixed pdf, also in solution<br>
		Q1.7 - fixed calculation in solution <br>
		Q2.1 - fixed Rmd solutions file <br>
		Q3.2 - swapped parts (a) and (b) around slightly (not a typo - I wanted to make the question better linked to the lectures) <br>
		Q3.4 - added this question, which changes the numbering of later 3.x questions <br>
		Sec 4.5 - fixed first paragraph <br>
		Q4.7 - fixed Weibull parametrization, and also in solution <br>
		Sec 5.3 - fixed minor typos inside the 'Alice and Bob' proof <br>
		Ex 5.3.4 - fixed some sign errors <br>
		Sec 7.2 - fixed 1/2 that should have been 1, in the last paragraph <br>
		Ex 7.2.3 - fixed &lt;1 that should be an &lt;a <br>
		Q7.2 - fixed theta that should have been p, in (b) specified that the number of trials is fixed <br>
		Sec 8.3 - corrected note on using random walk MCMC versus the range of the parameter space <br>
		Eqs (8.1), Ex 8.2.4, Q8.6 - corrected a Y and Q that were the wrong way around, in formulae for alpha <br>
		Reference sheets (Appendix A) - fixed mean of Gamma and Pareto distributions <br>
		Reference sheets (Appendix A) - fixed Weibull parametrization, in pdf and in conjugate pair with Gamma <br>
