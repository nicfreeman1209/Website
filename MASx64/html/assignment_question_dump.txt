We choose to model the heights of $20$ pine trees using the Bayesian model $(X,\Theta)$.
We assume that the heights of each tree are independent and
can be modelled as $M_\theta\sim \Normal(\theta,3)$
where $\theta\in\R$ is an unknown parameter.
Our prior beliefs are that $\Theta\sim\Normal(30,5)$.

The heights of $20$ pine trees are measured,
and recorded as $x=(x_i)_{i=1}^{20}$.
It is found that $\sum_{i=1}^{20}x_i=658$.
