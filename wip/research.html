<p>
	My research interests are in stochastic processes and applied probability, often towards situations in which finding a reasonable model (even in the qualitative sense) is a difficult mathematical problem.
</p>

<p>
	A common theme throughout much of my work is genealogies. Genealogies record relationships, and transfers, of information across time and space - such as a family tree,  or the spread of a news story. 				
	I have worked on several situations in which modelling, or analysing, the large-scale structure of a genealogy is a key issue.

				<p> <b> Population genetics </b> </p>
				
				<p>
				Population genetics studies the dyanmics of evolution, over long time-scales and for large numbers of organisms.
				My work in this area has focused on spatial effects related to natural selection, in particular on the relationship between spatial dimension and the rate at which natural selection progresses, and on the motion of a type of interface region (between distinct populations) known as a hybrid zone; in the context of the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot process.

				and an interface approximating mean curvature flow (right).
				</p>
				
				<p> <b> Perferential attachment & urn processes</b> </p>

				<p>
				Preferential attachment processes are randomly evolving graphs which seek to capture a 'rich get richer' mechanism. 
				For example, already popular holiday destinations tend to be viewed as disproportionately more attractive, and thus attract more new visitors; new users joining a social network are more likely to become friends with existing users who already have many friends.  
				In this area, I work on the interaction between the underlying appeal and the random effects that contribute towards information 'going viral'.

				Sample graphs from different models of preferential attachment.

				<p> <b> Forest fire processess </b> </p>
				
				<p>
				Forest fire processes (but not those which seek to model burning trees!) are interacting systems in which particles cluster together slowly and then suddenly break apart.
				My work in this area investigates a forest fire process which exhibits a phenomenon known as 'self-organized criticality', meaning that it has a natural propensity to move towards states that exhibit its most intricate behaviour.

				A simulation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model">Drossel-Schwabl model</a> (left), and a mean field version of the same model (right).
				</p>
				
				<p> <b> Coalescents, Webs and Nets </b> <p>
				
				Beginning with my D.Phil. thesis, my work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescent_theory">coalescent theory</a> focused on extensions of the Lamba-coalescent to spatial settings. More recently, I have also worked on  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_web">Brownian web</a> and the Brownian net.
				There is significant overlap between this area and population genetics, since examining a population model backwards in time typically results in connections to coalescent processes - in the same way that looking backwards through a family tree reveals children with common parents, grandparents, and so on.

				<p> <b> Fractals </b> <p>
				
				My interest in fractals stems from my first research project, dating from when I was an undergradate, into perturbations of iterated function systems. 
				I am not active in this area, but I have retained an interest in fractals, and particular in random fractals, ever since.
