            This is the course web page for the first semester of MAS223. Course notes (excluding some of the worked examples from lectures), exercises and solutions will be posted here.<br>

        <p><b>Lectures</b> will on Mondays at 12 noon (LT1, Dainton Building) and on Mondays at 3pm (LT1, Hicks Building).  There will be no lectures in week 7, which is SoMaS reading week.</p>

        <p><b>Exercises will be suggested</b> on Mondays, in lectures, in weeks 2,4,6,9 and 11.</p>

        <p><b>Tutorials</b> are 12-1 on Tuesdays or 1-2 on Thursdays, depending on which group you are in, during weeks 2,4,6,9 and 11. You can check which group you are in <a href="http://maths.dept.shef.ac.uk/maths/tutorials.php">here</a>, and see the full timetable <a href="http://maths.dept.shef.ac.uk/maths/module_info_1686.html#timetable">here</a>.</p>

        <p><b>Office hours</b> are from 4-5pm, on both Tuesdays and Thursdays, G18 in the Hicks building, every week except week 7. Occasionally I may be away and hold them at a different time; this will be announced in lectures.</p>

        <p><b>Assignments will be set</b> via email (& below), on Thursdays by 6pm, in weeks (weeks 2,4,6,9 and 11). Each will be a subset of the exercises suggested that week.</p>

        <p><b>Assignments will be due in</b> by 4pm, on Tuesday, in the week after it was set (weeks 3,5,8,10 and 12). They should be handed directly to me in lectures, or to the dropbox at F10 stapled together with the right <a href="https://sciencecoversheet.group.shef.ac.uk/">cover sheet</a> for your tutorial group.</p>

        <p><b>Solutions</b> will be made available (below) by 5pm, on Tuesdays after work is handed in (weeks 3,5,8,10 and 12).</p>

        <p><b>Assessment</b> is by an exam at the end of the whole course, and a practical project in the second semester of the course.  The reference sheet of distributions below will be made available in the exam.</p>

        <p>
            Lectures will use slides. The content of the slides is also available in the form of typed lecture notes.<br>
            Lectures will also include worked examples on the boards - students should take lecture notes by hand for these.
